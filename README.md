# Heimdall

Python based viewer for large multi-dimensional datasets.

Based on [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) and inspired by [BigDataViewer](https://imagej.net/BigDataViewer).
Can display datasets in memory or stored in [hdf5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/),
[bdv-format](https://imagej.net/BigDataViewer#Exporting_Datasets_for_the_BigDataViewer), [zarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python) or [n5](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5).
This is work in progress.
